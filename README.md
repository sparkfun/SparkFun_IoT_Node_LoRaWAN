The SparkFun IoT Node - LoRaWAN is a dual-action board that combines the exceptional LoRaWAN capabilities of the Digi XBee LR module with the RP2350 - a new family of microcontrollers from Raspberry Pi that offers significant enhancements over the RP2040 line. With Digi's Scan and Go Provisioning App, you'll have a data-ready device solution from development to operation up and running in no time.

Digi XBee LR modules are pre-activated on the Digi X-ON cloud platform for automated connection and two-way device management. The Digi XBee LR module provides a simplified Digi Embedded API and AT command interpreter to interface with your sensor over serial.
